- guibutton "frequent use:" => should it really open the server browser?
- buggy-master-mode-switch

- make a better readme
	=> explain how to add other translations

- different map realated todo's for every language?? makes this sense at all?
	=> if yes change the way the todos get saved
		=> saves all to ONE list, so it would be possible to easily delete all todos (better chances to keep the config.cfg clean)

- save the map related todo's and background thoughts into lists, not as inviduals vars
	=> will make it easier to keep the config.cfg clean!
	
- the var "zMULTICNLIST" gets "initialized" with a EMPTY value!? => why? it will get initialized everytime the config gets reloaded, as long as it dont get a value

- for what excatly is the var zQD used?

- 64b servers are gone => remove the information about it
	
- English Translate:
	* "current" should be called "background"
	* title in the NNA: keep "teleport" named "teleport" and not "teleporter", because the ent its called "teleport", 
		I expect that a lot of user would try to use /newent teleporter 
	
- German Translate:
	* "Cube" should be in German "Cube" too, think of the game name :P
	* "Map" should be also in German "Map"
