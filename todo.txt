- guibutton "frequent use:" => should it really open the server browser?
- buggy-master-mode-switch

- make a better readme

- different map realated todo's for every language?? makes this sense at all!?
	=> if yes change the way the todos get saved
		=> saves all to ONE list, so it would be possible to easily delete all todos

- Random Notes:
	* search for ">HERE" to find the lines on which i work atm
	
- English Translate:
	* "current" should be called "background"
	
- German Translate:
	* "Cube" should be in German "Cube" too, think of the game name :P
	* "Map" should be also in German "Map"
