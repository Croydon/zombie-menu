// DESCRIPTION:
//
// Our zombie.cfg is a new menu on your (F7) key, that helps us answering frequently asked newbie questions as well as providing useful functions, mini-tutorials and settings for editing in-game. It's also designed to make Master being less nerve-wrecking! =P
// Please feel free to improve it, or tell us what you would like to add or change (texts, functions, anything!). It's free software either! :D
//
// Note: The functions #sendto X (master forces a /getmap onto player with CN X), and prior to Collect Edition, #givemaster X (hands master over to the player with CN X) need (e.g.) http://github.com/vampirefrog/frogmod-justice or http://code.google.com/p/remod-sauerbraten/ or http://github.com/amstan/hyperserv installed on the server. (frogmod and remod available under the free ZLIB license (similar to Sauerbraten original), hyperserv under ZLIB + GPL v2.

///The First Great Refactor, by Kroltan
///With the objective of creating a more agile and straightforward to program menu
///Creates an API for internal functions and implements it as GUI later on. Will also create new commands for players who prefer typing to clicking
///Will be split into 3 files: zombie.cfg (loader, initialization, etc), zombie-api.cfg (core macros and functionality) and zombie-panel.cfg (GUI and client commands)
